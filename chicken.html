        Directions used in preparing chicken
    </h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Season chicken thighs on all sides with paprika, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook bacon in a cast iron skillet or oven-safe pan over medium-high heat until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from skillet and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Drain and discard excess grease from skillet. .</li>
            <li>Return skillet to medium heat and cook chicken thighs, skin-side down, for 3 to 4 minutes. Flip chicken over and place skillet in the preheated oven.</li>
            <li>Return skillet to the stove over medium-high heat. Pour in chicken broth while whisking up brown bits from the bottom of the skillet. Add mushrooms and cook until soft, about 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in heavy whipping cream and whisk together until lightly simmering, then reduce heat to medium-low. Season with salt and pepper, if necessary.</li>
            <li>Return chicken and any juices back into skillet; top with bacon and green onions. Serve immediately, spooning sauce over the chicken.</li>
