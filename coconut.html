      <strong>Some coconut coconut milk cake and its recipes</strong>
    </p>
<h2>
    Ingredients
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
    <li>4 eggs, separated</li>
    <li>1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>

</ul>
<h3>
    Directions
</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch cake pan.</li>
    <li>Beat sugar, butter, and egg yolks together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; add shredded coconut.</li>
    <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir creamed butter mixture, alternating with coconut milk, into flour mixture until batter is just mixed.</li>
    <li>Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. Fold egg whites into batter. Pour batter into the prepared cake pan.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes.</li>
</ol>
