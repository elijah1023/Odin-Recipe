   <h2>
       This is a brief note on this kinda of food.
   </h2>
   
   
   <p>I love serving saucy things over toast. And when that saucy thing is creamy garlic shrimp, and the toast it's over has been pan-fried in butter, I really love it. Frying the toast in lots of clarified butter prevents it from getting soggy while it soaks up the garlicky sauce. This creates a perfect partner, in both texture and taste, for the sweet shrimp.</p>  

    
   
   <p>Speaking of soaking up sauce, you don't have to butterfly the shrimp, but if you do take the extra 5 minutes, I think you'll love the results. The way the halved shrimp curl up when you cook them produces the perfect shape for grabbing lots of that creamy, garlicky goodness. Plus, it just looks cool.</p>  
    
    
   
   <p>I kept things very streamlined here, and there are many other ingredients you could add in, but I'm having a hard time thinking of too many that would make this any better than it already is. So, proceed with caution, but whether you embellish or not, I really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!</p> 
  
  
  
    <h3>
       Ingredients
   </h3>
  
  
  
   <ul>
       <li>12 ounces large shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
       <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
       <li>a teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
       <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed, or more to taste</li>
       <li>2 thick slices French bread</li>
       <li>6 tablespoons clarified butter, melted, divided</li>
       <li>2 teaspoons fresh lemon zest</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
       <li>a cup heavy cream</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh Italian parsley</li>
       <li>1 pinch salt, or to taste</li>
       <li>you can also add any additional ingredient you want</li>
   </ul>
   
   
   <h4>
       Procedure used in preparing
   </h4>
   
   <ol>
       <li>Trim most of the crusts off of the bread.</li>
       <li>Add 4 tablespoons melted butter to a skillet over medium heat. Add both slices of bread and toast until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove bread to a plate and wipe out any crumbs.</li>
       <li>Add remaining melted butter to the skillet and increase heat to high. When the pan is very hot and you see the first wisp of smoke, add shrimp and use tongs to spread into an even layer. Sear, without stirring or tossing, for 1 minute.</li>
       <li>Sprinkle with lemon zest and add lemon juice and cream. Stir with a spoon to scrape any browned bits off the bottom. Let cream boil and reduce for 1 to 2 minutes as the shrimp finishes cooking and the sauce thickens up.</li>
       <li>Turn off the heat and stir in parsley. Taste and add salt if needed.</li>
       <li>Divide shrimp and sauce evenly over each piece of toasted bread.</li>
   </ol>
